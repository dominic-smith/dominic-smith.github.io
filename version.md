I use a version numbering system for papers based on software versioning numbers. Each version consists of 3 numbers (e.g. 1.2.4). These numbers are explained in order.

* Major Release Number - Major releases are differentiated by substantial changes including rewrites of multiple sections, significant changes in estimates, and/or changes in framing. These changes may cause previous citations to no longer be correct. 
* Minor Release Number - Minor releases involve small rewrites, updates to literature, and small number changes. The message of the paper should not change between minor releases, but figures and tables may vary slightly. These changes are typically made in response to feedback from a small number of individuals. Most individuals will not care about these changes.
* Patch Number - Patches involve fixing typos and formating. These versions should be considered essentially identical.
