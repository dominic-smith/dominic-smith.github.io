               <div>(Draft pending release of results)</div>

                <div class="summary">Large firms increasingly dominate the retail sector, as evidenced by the growth of general merchandisers such as Walmart and Target.  Most of what is known about concentration and the growth of large retailers is based on industry-level studies with aggregate data.  I show that the growth of general merchandisers biases industry-level concentration measures in unpredictable ways.  Using new data on store-level revenue for all U.S. retailers by eight major categories of goods I show the aggregate HHI doubled between 1997 and 2007 while local concentration increased by 50 percent.  Then, I study a potential cause of rising concentration, increasing direct imports of consumer goods by large retailers.  I construct a store-level measure of exposure to direct imports of large retailers and find that increased exposure to direct imports from competing retailers increases exit of small stores. Finally, I use the model from Arcidiacono, Bayer, Blevins, and Ellickson (2016) to estimate the net effect of imports on the structure of competition in  clothing sales, a department highly affected by imports.  </div>

            <div class="paper"> The Evolution of Retail Concentration</div>
                <div class="summary">Aggregate concentration in retail has risen substantially in the past 30 years, but local concentration has increased much less.  I use data on store-level revenue for all U.S. retailers by eight major categories of goods to show that increases in local concentration are broad-based.  Almost all markets have become more concentrated in almost all departments.  I show the two drivers for the difference between aggregate concentration and local concentration are the expansion of national retailers into more markets and the rise of multi-department stores such as Walmart and Target.  I quantify the extent to which consumers in different markets shop at the same stores and find this has risen substantially over time, even in departments with small increases in concentration.

                <div class="summary">The “factoryless manufacturing” (FM) business model is employed by a rising share of U.S. firms. Factoryless manufacturers outsource the fabrication of products but maintain control of the production process, own the associated intellectual property, and bear the entrepreneurial risk. FM is an important component in the role of U.S. firms in global manufacturing value chains. We estimate the scope of U.S. factoryless manufacturing using three approaches. First, we use financial reports for S&P 500 companies to show that FM is prevalent and increasing in the United States and that FM, once only common in the production of apparel, electronics, toys, and pharmaceuticals, has spread to a broader array of products. Second, we use Economic Census microdata to estimate that manufacturing value-added would have been 5 to 20 percent greater for 2007 if all FGPs were reclassified to manufacturing. Third, using a list of FM semiconductor companies matched to Economic Census microdata, we estimate that value-added would be 20 to 30 percent greater for semiconductor manufacturing, an industry where FM is especially prevalent, if FGPs were included. These results suggest that outsourcing and offshoring of product fabrication by U.S. firms is coupled with significant domestic production management. Thus, identifying FGPs in economic data is important for the study of fragmentation and globalization. </div>
