# Basker, Klimek, and Van (2012)

Show that general-merchandise chains grew much faster than specialist retail chains between 1977 and 2007.  Show that GMs that added the most stores also made the biggest increases in their product offerings.  Explain these facts with a stylized model in which a retailer's scale economies interact with consumer gains from one-stop shopping to generate a complementarity between a retailer's scale and scope.
