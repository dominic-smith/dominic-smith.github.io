This paper uses the U.S. Economic Census to investigate the causes of the fall of the labor share.  It blames the fall in the labor share on the rise of "superstar firms."  The authors claim superstar firms, the most productive firms in each industry, have become more dominant over time.  These firms have a low share of labor relative to value added or sales.  Thus as the importance of these firms increases the aggregate labor share falls.

They show industry sales are increasingly concentrated in a small number of firms, industries where concentration rises most have the largest decline in the labor share, the fall in the labor share is driven by between-firm reallocation.

# Industry Level Concentration

The authors provide sector level concentration in both employment and sales for six sectors of the U.S. economy between 1982 and 2012.  In Manufacturing top 20 sales concentration has risen from 68 to 74 percent, finance 48 to 62, services 21 to 27, utilities and transportation 58 to 64, retail trade 30 to 45, and wholesale trade 42 to 58.
